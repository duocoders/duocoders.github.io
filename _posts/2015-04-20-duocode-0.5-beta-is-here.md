Phew! It's finally here - a brand new beta release of DuoCode! Here's what we got for you:

## What's new in 0.5?
<br/>

#### Advanced configuration

We've added a new DuoCode project property page to further control the compilation process. It is available for all DuoCode projects on Visual Studio 2013 and above.

#### Debugging

We've also made debugging support available on Visual Studio 2013. When using Internet Explorer, you can debug your project straight from the IDE!

In addition, we've added support for [Chrome (V8) stack-trace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi), (via [node-source-maps-support](https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support)) allowing you to get complete <strong>C# call stack</strong> for exceptions right in the browser:

We've added support for Web publishing from Visual Studio - Web, FTP, file system and publishing to Azure now work as expected!
<br/>

#### Shared projects

DuoCode now supports [Shared Projects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn771552.aspx), a feature that was added in Visual Studio 2013 to assist cross-platform development. You can target several platforms, such as Xamarin and Apache Cordova with a single solution!
