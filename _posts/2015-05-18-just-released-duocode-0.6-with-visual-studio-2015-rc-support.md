title: "Just released: DuoCode 0.6 with Mono 4 and Visual Studio 2015 RC support!"
---

Big news today! We have just released DuoCode 0.6 - with full support for Mono 4, support for Visual Studio 2015 RC and several [important bugfixes](http://duoco.de/version-history)! Check your Visual Studio Extensions Gallery for updates, or [download the new version](http://duoco.de/download) from our website.

### Mono / xbuild support

This is the first release where we officially support Mono 4! We've tested our compiler on Mono running on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and OSX - all tests pass with flying colors! (actually, just one color: <font color="green">green</font>)

Your DuoCode projects are now truly cross-platform with the support for xbuild (Mono's MSBuild alternative) - build your projects from the command line on all platforms!

### Try DuoCode in your browser!

In addition, we've released [Try DuoCode](http://duoco.de/try) - an online playground for trying out DuoCode right in your browser - without downloading anything. You can use it to convert your C# code into JavaScript on the fly, then **run** and **debug** in your browser's developer tools!

Happy coding!
